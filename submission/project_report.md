### Feature Extraction and Machine Learning Models
Following steps are performed for feature extractions
#### Preprocessing
Images are read from the source files and visualized. One important thing to noticed here is that - most images belong to rear view of the car (_this is has some effect on detection, as discussed in last section_) Once images are read, I tried changing colorspaces and plot the histogram of colors to see how vehicle and non-vehicle classes deferred. I tried RGB, YCrCb, HSV and HSL colorspaces with 16, 32 and 64 bin sizes. HSV and HLS colorspaces with 32 bins were choosen as they looked promising.

Below is the sample image showing vehicle and non-vehicle data:

![data](../output_images/data_display.png)

Example of HSV histogram for vehicle and non-vehicle data:

![hsv-hist](../output_images/hsv_histogram.png)

#### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
This was done as a part of [preprocessing][ppr] and [feature selection](fsel1) steps. I tried following options:
- pix_per_cell: [4,8]
- cell_per_block: [2,4]
- orient: [7,8,9]
- Image size: (32x32), (64x64)
- Color spaces: Gray, RGB (individual channels), HSV (individual channels)

Based on different tests, I could make following observations:
- Using (32x32) image size helped reduce the feature vector size. Using (64x64) images gave better accuracy.
- 9 orientations gave better results than 7 or 8 orientations
- cell_per_block=2,pix_per_cell=4,orient=8, img_resize=(32,32) for HOG feature on grayscale images with 16 bin histogram of RGB channels gave a 99.07%/98.98% train/test accuracy. But was very poor on actual road images. This was a clear call to use different feature vectors
- cell_per_block=2,pix_per_cell=8,orient=9, img_resize=(64,64) for HOG features and 32 bin histogram for HSV colorspaces gave a fair performance of 98.93% accuracy on test set, but could detect cars on actual road images fairly well.

Below image shows the HOG image for vehicle data for R, G, B channels and Gray image

#### Machine Learning Models
This process is done togather with previous step. I tried Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the HOG+Color features and conducted a grid search to evaluate their performance.


__SVM Classifier__
I tried following parameters for SVM clasifier:
- kernel: 'linear', 'rbf'
- C: [1, 10, 100, 1000]
- gamma: [0.1, 0.001,0.0001]

Top performing results:

| Rank | kernel | gamma | C | Validation Accuracy | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | rbf | 0.001 | 10 | 0.993 |
| 2 | rbf | 0.001 | 100 | 0.993 |
| 3 | rbf | 0.001 | 1000 | 0.993 |

Clearly 'rbf' kernel with 0.001 gamma performs well. I double checked the accuracy numbers to be sliglty different in 4th or 5ht precision nummbers. 

__Random Forest Classifier__
I tried RF classifier cross validation with following parameters:
- max_depth": [3, None]
- max_features: [1, 3, 10]
- min_samples_split: [1, 3, 10]
- min_samples_leaf: [1, 3, 10]
- bootstrap: [True, False]
- criterion": ["gini", "entropy"]

Best performing RF classifiers gave a good accuracy of ~99% on validation set, but were not effective on real road images sliding window search. 


### Sliding Window Search

Sliding window technique is used to detect the cars in the video frame. Each video frame is divided into number of windows and these windows are used to test using the trained machine learning model. We can use multiple size window to detect the cars which appear to be of different size depending on their position in the image.

Instead of using whole of image, we can define the region of interest, where we generally see the cars. We can also try to reduce the size of imagea and try to use sliding windows. This is done by trial and error on the given dataset. One such attempt is depicted below:

![roi](../output_images/roi.png)

The red border shows the area used for sliding window. Image below shows how we can fit a sliding window in region of interest:

![swin](../output_images/swin.png)

When deciding on multiple scales for window size, we can use some clever techniques of adjusting the position of the window sizes. Use larger window sizes in whole ROI and smaller window sizes near the horizon lines. Below images shows such arrangement for just two window sizes:

![multi](../output_images/multi.png)

I used a 50% overlap of windows to achieve a good result. Increasing the overlap resulted in multiple detections and did not improve the overall performance.

__Multiple Detections__

Using multiple window sizes might result in multiple detection of same car. Since we have a 50% overlap, it's possible that the algorithm detects in multiple scales as well as multiple window positions. Below shows one such example:

![multi_det](../output_images/multi_det.png)

I used the technique mentioned in the lecture to handle this case. Using heat map based threshold to detect the center of the car and draw a boundary around it. This performed well and below pic represents one result:

![heat](../output_images/heat.png)



### Video Implementation

Video implementation was just similar to all the steps mentioned above, but with a few differences. Video makes it easier to handle false positives and track based on previous frame information.

__False Positives__

Our classifier sometime misclassifies the non-vehicle window portions as the vehicle images. This results in a false positives. These can be handled if we know the previous frame information. I fixed this issue using a very simple technique shown below:

```python
from collections import deque
from functools import reduce
# have a dqueue of last 5 frames
heatmaps=deque(maxlen=5)

def process_video(frame):
    bbox_list=get_bboxlist(frame)
    heatmaps.append(add_heat(np.zeros_like(frame[:,:,0]).astype(np.float),bbox_list))
    # detect as a car only if it appears in 2 or more frames
    heatmap = apply_threshold(reduce(lambda x,y: x + y, heatmaps), 2)
    labels = label(heatmap)
    plt.imshow(labels[0], cmap='gray')
    return draw_labeled_bboxes(frame, labels)
```

I create a fixed length queue using `dqueue` and apply a threashold of 2. This makes sure that only when 2 or more consecutive frames detect a car, that window is classified as car.

### Discussion

#### 1. Feature Vectors

I need to spend some more time on deciding on the right feature vectors. When the size of features is more than 1000, it takes too long to train and test and hance can not be real time.

#### <a name="back_view"></a> 2. Back view problem

As alluded before, most of the images in the dataset contain the backside view of the car. We do see left and right portions of the car in our camera frames. If we can train the machine learning model with side view of the cars, I hope we can get much better results.

#### 3. CNN based features

Use convolution neural networks to get the features. Datasets like CIFAR-10 have car categories and can be used to get better features.
